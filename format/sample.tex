% Template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
% Written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% Use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% Make two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.

% Adapted by Michael Oudshoorn for the Australasian Computer Science
% Conference and the Australasian Database Conference 1995.

% Further changes by Rodney Topor, Harald Sondergaard Guozhu Dong,
% and Alistair Moffat and James Thom for ACSC'96, ADC'96, CATS'96,
% DASFAA'97, ADCS97, ADCS98, and trivial ones by David Hawking for
% ADCS99, James Thom for ADCS2002, and Alistair Moffat (again!) for
% ADCS 2004.

% For versions before LaTeX2e:
% \documentstyle[sample,twocolumn]{article}
% (then delete the next two lines).

\paragraph*{Abstract}
%IEEE allows italicized abstract
\noindent
{\it 
The abstract should be about 200 words, in a 10-point italic
font such as Times (preferred) or Computer Modern.
It should summarise the scope and contribution of the paper in a
concise and accurate manner without references to other works.
The title should be centred in a 14-point Roman bold font followed by
the authors names, affiliations, and either e-mail addresses or home
page URL.
Phone and fax numbers should be omitted.
} 

\paragraph*{Keywords} 
A list of keywords based on those given in the Call for Papers should
be included.


\section{Overall format}

Papers should be prepared for A4 paper, with 25~mm margins
(equivalently, the text height should be 247~mm and the width 160~mm),
using left and right justification, in a 10-point Roman font such as
Times (preferred) or Computer Modern, in two-column
format.\footnote{Footnotes may be used and should be in 7 point text,
  numbered from 1 through the text.}  The gutter between the columns
should be 5~mm wide.  No page headers, footers or numbers should be
included.

Citations should be in the IEEE style, for example
Hoare~\cite{Hoare73}, or Ganapathi and
Fischer~\cite{GanapathiFischer82}, or Barnes~\cite{Barnes80,Barnes89}.

Do \emph{not} include page numbers in your paper.

%Authors submitting printed copy should number the pages by writing on
%the back of each page in light pencil.  An 8 page limit on paper
%length will be strictly enforced for full papers and 3 pages for short
%papers.

Note that this document is primarily concerned with the
\emph{appearance} of submitted papers.  Please read the Call for
Papers for information on the desired \emph{content} of submitted
papers.


\section{Detailed formatting instructions}

Now for some details.

\subsection{Caption at the lower left corner}

The lower left corner of the first page of your paper should include a
caption showing the name of the conference and the conference dates,
as is shown in this sample paper.  If your paper is prepared other
than with {\LaTeX}, please ensure that you duplicate the required
wording into your paper.


\subsection{Section headings}

Section headings should be numbered and be in a 12-point bold
font, and be in the mixed-case style used in this sample document.

Authors should leave 15~points of space before a section heading and
5~points of space after it.  The first paragraph of each (sub)section
should not be indented.  All other paragraphs should be indented by
5~mm.

Subsection headings should also be in a 12-point bold font.

Subsubsections should not be used.

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be displayed as near as possible to the
first reference to them in the text.  Captions should be centered
below the display and figures and tables should be numbered
consecutively.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\hfil
\hbox{
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\\[6mm]
Insert your figure here\\[10mm]
\hline
\end{tabular}\hfil
}
\caption{An example figure.}
\end{figure}

Try to avoid having lots of horizontal and vertical lines in your
tables---intelligent use of whitespace is far more effective.

\section{\protect{Information for \LaTeX\ users}}

This document \verb+sample.tex+ (and corresponding style files
\verb+sample.sty+ and \verb+sample.bst+) is available as a {\LaTeX}
source file via the conference home page:

\begin{center}
\url{http://es.csiro.au/adcs2009}
\end{center}

%% For versions before {\LaTeX2e} (such as {\LaTeX}2.09), you should replace
%% the following two lines
%% 
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
%% \usepackage{sample}
%% \end{verbatim}
%% 
%% which are at the beginning of the file \verb+sample.tex+, by the line
%% 
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% \documentstyle[sample,twocolumn]{article}
%% \end{verbatim}
%% 
%% %% Your main \LaTeX\ input file will then have the form:
%% %% 
%% %% \begin{verbatim}
%% %% \documentstyle[sample,twocolumn]{article}
%% %% \bibliographystyle{sample}
%% %% \title{My title}
%% %% \author{See example in sample.tex}

\section{Other information}

Some more stuff that you need to know.

\subsection{Submission}

Submissions to ADCS 2009 should be sent according to the directions at
\url{http://es.csiro.au/adcs2009}.  \emph{Do not send your {\LaTeX}
  source, or PostScript, or a MS-Word file.  Send only a printable PDF
  version.}

All submissions must be original work, not previously published 
elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
journal.

Submissions that differ markedly in length or style from these
guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration.

\subsection{Submission length}

Submissions of full-length papers should be at most 3000 words, or
eight pages in this style.  Submissions for Posters, Short papers,
Industry Status Reports, and Demonstrations should be appoximately
1500 words long, or four pages in this required style.

\subsection{Timetable}

The deadline for submissions, and the timetable for notifications,
appears on the conference home page.

\subsection{Registration}

Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the
conference to present the paper.

Registration information will be sent with letters of acceptance, and
will also be available from the conference home page.

\subsection{Conference information}

General information about the conference may be found at the
conference home page:
