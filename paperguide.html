<p>Sample LaTeX and BibTeX style files for ADCS 2009 are available as
follows:</p>

<p>The LaTeX source file <a href="format/sample.tex">sample.tex</a>
which you should use as a basis for your paper;<br/>

The LaTeX style file <a href="format/sample.sty">sample.sty</a>
which is used by sample.tex;<br/>

The sample BibTeX style
file <a href="format/sample.bst">sample.bst</a>;<br/>

A sample BibTeX
bibliography <a href="format/sample.bib">sample.bib</a><br/>

The PDF version of the sample
file <a href="format/sample.pdf">sample.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>If at all possible, LaTeX should be used for paper preparation.  If
you do not have access to LaTeX, then you may use MS-Word, but please
ensure that it conforms to the guidelines, and the appearance is as
close as possible to <a href="format/sample.pdf">sample.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Submissions of full-length papers should be approximately 3000
words, or eight pages in the required style.  Submissions for Posters,
Short papers, Industry Status Reports, and Demonstrations (if any of
the above) should be appoximately 1500 words long, or four pages in
the required style.</p>

<p>All submissions must be original work, not previously published 
elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
journal.</p>

<p>Submissions that differ markedly in length or style from these
guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration.</p>
